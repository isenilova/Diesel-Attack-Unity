# Diesel-Attack

Full user experience 
User is able to receive in-game currency (DPoints) for activities inside the game - killing enemies. All of these points stay available after player ends current level (win or lose). All data including player progress is stored in our TON smart contracts completely on-chain.

Player can spend DPoints using Lucky Roll (prize randomizer) and receive some in-game boost – advanced weapon or in-game skin for ship. The probability to receive each weapon depends on the weapon power and other attributes. All weapons can be upgraded by their copies, but the weapon level has top limit.

If player qualifies for claimed reward, we mint for him or her new NFT on the fly or upgrade existing one, while user needs to authorize with a wallet only once starting the game. In other case, user can imminently burn the reward in exchange of DPoints, or mint NFT anyway and sell it on Getgems (integrated into the game) or any other marketplace.

All the users who passed some level successful are able to claim proof-of-skill SBT related to this level. These SBTs & total number of DPoints owned by user affect the personal rating & the place on the Leaderboard. Winners receive TON coin prizes every in-game season!

Users can buy the pack with DPoints to boost their account. The majority of money received from selling packs forms the Prize Pool. As soon as the the current Prize Pool total value is reached, in-game season ends & Winners receive their prizes in real TONs.

The Prize Pool size for the next season is managed by smart contract according to the community voting & decision making (best DAO-governance practices alike). The voting is available for all the Diesel Attack TG channel members.

Diesel Attack is a beautiful post-apocalyptic world inhabited by wonderful mechanisms with unique in-game mechanics. It is the hardcore 2D-sidescroller, it supports keyboard and joystick game control, suitable for speedrun walkthrough & competition around this.

As a both, gamedevs & web3 enthusiasts we believe in mass adoption of cryptogames. So, we are trying to build web3 game suitable for non web3-natives. TON is the great choice for us due to the opportunity to address our game for web2 Telegram users. Sustainable architecture, cheep & fast transactions are also very important.

Our proposal combines the most popular engagement instruments from web2 gamedev (such as gacha, farm, drops, adventure, competitions, etc.) with web3-native ones (such as earn-driven mechanics, collectibles, DeSoc & DAO-governance elements, community-driven product). We think, that it can help broad audience users to better understand all the blockchain technology advantages, increase their interest of using web3 products, and, as a consequence, increase the number of transactions inside the ecosystem.

We also believe, that NFT is able to be not just an exclusive & unusual digital active. But SBTs & utility NFTs can be a powerful instrument for identity & engagement. That’s why we propose the clear benefits for Diesel Attack SBTs & NFTs ownership, interesting for both, web2 & web3 target audiences. Tokenomics implementation using DPoints is the topic of our future R&D.
